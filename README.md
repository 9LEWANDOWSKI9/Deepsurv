This is the code based on the CPH model. The loss function is the function of Cox, called Partial Likelihood function.

TCGA dataset is downloaded from the US Cancer Center, which is a high-dimensional nonlinear dataset. 80% to train and 20% to test.

Moreover, we promote the application to the recommedation treatment by using this model. Change the dataset and change the concomitant variable from genetic expression to the features of treatment.
